# pydproc

Pydproc is python3 package that provides a simple to use command line interface for periodic data retrieval from APIs. Using inputs from a yaml, pydproc builds a new docker image specific to that process. The user can then run, stop, and restart these processes for pydproc to start collecting data. When the user wants this data, they can easily retrieve it along with the run logs. This can help generate new datasets for machine learning projects as it was originally intended to get selling prices for betting markets.

## Installation

Pydproc can be installed using pip:

    pip install pydproc
